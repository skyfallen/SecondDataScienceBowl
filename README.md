SecondDataScienceBowl
We competed in the Second Annual Data Science Bowl competition on Kaggle.com as part of the team HeartRateBeaters
The data is located in /storage/hpc_dmytro/Kaggle/SDSB
Heart Views.

The main view for assessing ventricle size is the short axis stack,
which contains images taken in a plane perpendicular to the long axis of the left ventricle.
These have the prefix "sax_" in the competition dataset.

Most cases also have alternative views, which you should feel free to incorporate into your methodology.

"2ch" -2chamber view-contains the view of left atrium and left ventricle
"4ch"- 4chamber view, shows all 4 chambers of the heart.
